        "text": "The first line of code ever written is attributed to Ada Lovelace, a 19th century mathematician and writer.\n Lovelace was the daughter of famed poet Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke Byron, who legally separated two months after her birth. Her father then left Britain forever, and his daughter never knew him personally. She was educated privately by tutors and then self-educated but was helped in her advanced studies by mathematician-logician Augustus De Morgan, the first professor of mathematics at the University of London. She worked with Charles Babbage on his early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and is considered the first computer programmer. \n Lovelace wrote an algorithm in 1843 intended to be processed by the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This algorithm is the first example of computer programming, even though Babbage's machine was never fully constructed during their lifetimes. \n Her work was visionary and laid to the foundation for future programming and computing. Ada Lovelace visionary thinking went beyond mere number-crunching, which is what her contemporaries primarily focused on. Her notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine contain reflections that went much deeper, hinting at the idea that machines could do more than calculate, they could potentially process symbols and patterns to solve a variety of problems, this refers to the idea of processing information or executing algorithms based on data. She speculated that computers could one day create music, art, or even write text, as long as human provided the right instructions."

        "dates": "620–564 BCE;",
        "text": "Considered the initiator of the fable as a written literary form, Aesop tells archetypal fables, that is, short compositions in which, in most cases, the protagonists are anthropomorphized animals. \nSome of the most famous fables are: -The Fox and the Grapes, -The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, and -The Ant and the Grasshopper. These have an educational and didactic purpose, as they aim to impart practical lessons, serving as exempla. \nAesop, traditionally credited as the author of a collection of Greek fables, is likely a legendary figure rather than a historical person. Ancient sources like Herodotus (5th century BCE) claimed he lived in the 6th century BCE as a slave, while Plutarch (1st century CE) suggested he advised King Croesus of Lydia. Some traditions say he was from Thrace, Phrygia, or even Ethiopia. An Egyptian text from the 1st century CE describes him as a slave on the island of Samos who later became a riddle-solver for King Lycurgus of Babylon before meeting his death at Delphi. It's likely the name Aesop was created to give authorship to fables, and his name became synonymous with fable.The value of these stories lay in the moral lessons they conveyed rather than the tales themselves."

A few of them are minor prose masterpieces, most notably -The Happy Prince, -The Nightingale and the Rose, -The Selfish Giant, and -The Fisherman and His Soul. \n In July of 1889 Wilde settled down to write The Picture of Dorian Gray. This is his only novel, a blend of French decadence and English gothicism and is considered a literary manifesto of aestheticism."

During this period, he read and studied authors such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kant and Leopardi, who had an impact on his thought and poetics. permeated by nihilism, scepticism and pessimism. His aphorisms, also due to personal experiences, initially a very severe form of insomnia that affected him from adolescence, are in fact pervaded by a deep bitterness and misanthropy, which are however served with acute irony and literary elegance. In the realm of philosophical thought, Cioran stands out as a figure who transcends the established norms of his time and does not belong to any specific movement or school of thought. His style is sharp, direct, and deeply emotional, filled with paradoxes, contradictions, and oxymorons. He wrote not to share his ideas with an audience, but rather to alleviate his own suffering and cause a kind of rude awakening from reality."

        "text": "As a young man of letters graduating from the University of Turin with a thesis on the poetry of Walt Whitman, Pavese translated both classic and recent American and British authors that were then new to the Italian public. After University, Pavese threw himself into all manner of literary work, from producing his own poems, stories, and novels, to translating and editing English literature. Best defined as an aesthetic anti-fascist and anti-political ethicist, despite only marginally participating in anti-fascist meetings, it was at one of these that he fell in love with Tina Pizzardo, secretly a member of the Communist Party, for whom he received letters from a dissident's prison, and was imprisoned for it.  ‘The woman with the raspy voice’, as he called the love that came into his life in his later years of university studies, cost him a charge of suspected anti-fascism and a sentence of confinement. On his return in 1936, the woman had already married someone else. Disappointment plunged him into such a crisis that he contemplated suicide. In Rome, he meets the actress Constance Bowling, who will renew in him first the feeling of love, then the pain of abandonment. Pavese writes the famous poem: \"Verrà la morte e avrà i tuoi occhi\". Worn out, tired but ultimately perfectly lucid, he took his own life in a room of the Hotel Roma in Turin by swallowing a strong dose of barbiturates. Just a note, on the first page of the Dialogues with Leucò, on the bedside table in the room: ‘I forgive everyone and to everyone I ask forgiveness. All right? Don't gossip too much'. \n Pavese's work is intimately connected to his suffered human and intellectual life. From the very beginning of his literary interests, he seems to have tried his hardest in the difficult attempt to adapt his expressive abilities to his inner impulses. Myth assumes central importance in Pavese's poetics; Myth is the consecration of unique places linked to a fact or an event, a place is given absolute meaning, isolating it from the world; with the theory of myth, Pavese fixes and defines his original intuitions of childhood and the landscape linked to it. Childhood is the privileged moment in which myth is experienced spontaneously and unconsciously; when one realises this, childhood is lost; "

Afro-Beat emerged as a genre in the late 1960s, and Fela Kuti is widely credited as its principal architect. It combines elements of jazz, Yoruba rhythms, and funk. Kuti was the son of feminist and labour activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. He is adored and regarded as a legend. With his music, he gave a voice to the oppressed, used it as a tool to address important issues that had so far gone unheeded, such as the corruption of the Nigerian government, and encouraged social change. He sang in English and Yoruba. His politically charged songs, prompted authorities to routinely raid his club, looking for reasons to jail him. A 1977 raid on Fela's house by Nigerian authorities resulted in his brief incarceration, the assault of his wives and the defenestration of his mother, who died the following year due to complications from the fall. Despite all the challenges, after an exil in Ghana, he came back to found the political party: the Movement of the People, and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Nigeria. After all Kuti was a blunt supporter of human rights, his resistance and braveness made him one of the activist that shaped his country and represents his people. Since his death in 1997, Kuti’s legacy lives on and has birthed a new generation of activists who idolise his resilience in fighting the tyranny of the system. "

Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. While working as an engineer, he translated some books to earn extra money. In 1840 he wrote his first novel: Poor Folks, which introduced him to the literary circles and costed him a death sentence to partecipate in one of them where banned books were discussed. However the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In the following years, he worked as a journalist. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic. Despite the profoundity of his major works, he is commonly regarded as one of the greatest psychologists in the history of literature. In his works he analyses states of mind that lead to extreme actions and explore the deepest emotions and in so doing is treating timeless issues of philosophy. The Brothers Karamazov (Russian: Бра́тья Карама́зовы, Brát'ya Karamázovy), is the last novel by the Russian author. It has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature. "

He left law-school when young to became a self-made journalist. In the late 1960s he left journalism to devote himself to his creative writing full-time. He is one of the foremost interpreters of magical realism in literature, a genre in which the background narrative is set in a real place and time, but supernatural and dreamlike elements are part of the portrayal, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts.
